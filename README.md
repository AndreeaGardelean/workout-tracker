# Workout Tracker

The Workout Tracker application helps to monitor workouts and track the progress over time. Inspired by the principles outlined in the book Atomic Habits by James Clear, this app is designed to encourage daily streaks and provide a clear, visual representation of your achievements.

## Purpose

In Atomic Habits, the author emphasizes that building new habits (hopefully healthy ones) is more effective when progress is tracked visually. For example, if youâ€™ve maintained a 7-day streak, the visual feedback can motivate you to continue. This application brings that concept to life.

## Features

#### Calendar View:

Mark the days when you perform your habits, visually tracking your streaks.

#### Workout Details:

Add detailed records of your workouts, including:

- Specific exercises performed.
- Progress photos.
- Additional notes to track your fitness journey.
  Streak Motivation: See your streaks grow as you consistently engage in your habits, motivating you to keep going.
